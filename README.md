# financeTracker

## Someone criticizes you for being financially illiterate? Prove them that you are not!

### Simple finance tracker for (ofc not) financially illiterate people like me, made in python.

## How to run
Just basically run the project, choose ui or cli approach, it is up to you, what you prefer.

## How to run tests
There are no tests yet lol.

## UI
Easy to use, just type in your latest expense and add it. It will appear on the UI and count the amount to the others expenses. There is local database for it.
